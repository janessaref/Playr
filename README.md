# PLAYR


## Description 
Welcome to our music playlist generator. Here is an easy way to access music, create playlist all at the click of a button avoiding all the clutter. Here you will be presented with a well and modern designed page. At the top you will find a search bar, the user types in the artist, song or genre of their liking and a search button. Once the user presses the search button the user will be directed to a music player containing all of the songs related to the artist, song, or genre. Here you will also find a history section that will contain all the playlist you have searched for in the past. The user will also have the ability to delete non desired playlist at the click of the delete button next to the playlist name.

## User_Story
I am a full time Collage student who has a very busy schedule. Most of the time I spend in my car or in my room studying. I want an easy to use app that will generate music from multiple sources and create a playlist. I also want to save my playlist for easy access so that next time I can listen to my music at the click of a button.
